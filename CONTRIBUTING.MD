# Notes for maintainers

## Compile locally

        git clone git@github.com:solven-eu/cleanthat.git
        mvn install -Pfast

The `-Pfast` profile may be necessary to circumvent cleanthat depenending on itself to apply `spotless` on itself.

Once done (or re-done after a release), you can simply:

        mvn install

## Deploy into Production (AWS):

        git push origin master:deploy-prd

## Release a new version (and deploy jars to Sonatype m2central):

        mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform

### In case of failure

The release process may fail for various reasons:

- Sonatype timed-out

They, one would typically need to revert its local head, and force push master before the release. And delete the falsy tags:

        git tag -d v2.XX.RELEASE
        git push --delete origin v2.XX.RELEASE

### New computer, new GPG Key
